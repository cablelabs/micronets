      <guid>https://cablelabs.github.io/micronets/test-components/qr-code-scanner/</guid>
      <description>Abstract This document describes QRCode scanning to authorize an MSO subscriber (in this case, onboarding a medical device onto the subscriber&amp;rsquo;s WiFi network.)
Application Source code for this application is in the micronets-idora-client repository. It is a multi-platform mobile application written using the Cordova framework.
Required Servers The following servers are required to setup an IdOra account and link it to an MSO&amp;rsquo;s Micronets applications - micronets-auth-server - micronets-idora-server
Note: When these servers (docker containers) are pulled and started, there should be a grandma/grandma account already created that is pre-authorized for MSO login via QRCode scanning.</description>
